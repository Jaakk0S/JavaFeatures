# Java 14 New Features

The most important new features with Java 14 are:
- Switch expressions, see [SwitchExpressions.java](SwitchExpressions.java)
  - Switch _expressions_ evaluate to a single value
- Text blocks are extended with:
  - `\`: indicates end of line
  - `\s`: indicates a single space
- Helpful NullPointerExceptions: they will now indicate what is null
